## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

    -   Build the project (`Ctrl+Shift+B`) to automatically restore all necessary dependencies.

3.  **Configure API Keys**
    -   Open the `AppSetting.json` file and add your API keys and custom prompts:
        ```json
        {
          "Groq_Api_Key": "your-groq-api-key-here",
          "Groq_Prompt_Api_Key1": "your-groq-api-key1(for prompt1)-here",
          "Groq_Prompt_Api_Key2": "your-groq-api-key1(for prompt2)-here"
        }
        ```

##  Usage

### Voice Commands

-   Launch the application and use the microphone icon or a designated hotkey to activate voice commands.
-   Speak naturally, for example:
    -   *"Open Chrome"*
    -   *"Search for AI research papers on Google"*
    -   *"Open Spotify"*
    -   *"Open Resume.pdf"* 
    -   *"Shutdown the PC"
    -   *"Reduce Brightness by 10%"* 


### File Scanning

-   RAVE performs an automatic scan on its first launch and subsequently on a daily basis or as set by the user to keep its index current.
-   It indexes `.exe`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, and `.txt` files to facilitate faster access through voice commands.
-   It also uses `FileWatcher` to keep a track of files or application being modified, added or removed while the app is running.

### Command History

-   The command history is accessible from the main dashboard and history section.
-   You can review all previous commands, their outcomes, and the timestamps of when they were executed.
